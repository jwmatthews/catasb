# To use openshift origin latest, uncomment these lines:
# origin_image_tag: latest
# openshift_client_version: latest

# broker_tag controls what version of ansible broker to deploy
# defaults to "latest", use "canary" if you want to test latest built code from master
# broker_tag: "latest"
# broker_tag: "canary"

## WARNING: By default, broker_version will be set from broker_tag
##          If you set broker_tag to a custom tag, i.e. no v3.9, v3.10, latest
##          then you need to set broker_version to the version of the broker
##          version meaning the openshift release the broker was released in
# broker_version: "v3.10"

# Example using 3.9 images
# openshift_client_version: '3.9'
# origin_image_tag: v3.9
# broker_tag: v3.9
#
# You can override other variables as needed.  For example to change your OpenShift hostname
# you can modify the hostname and suffix here:
# hostname: 172.17.0.1
# openshift_routing_suffix: 172.17.0.1.nip.io

# Default to the "anyuid" scc for pod deployments.
